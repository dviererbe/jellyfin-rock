## Setup Instructions

### 1. Start a new repository from this template

Check GitHub's documentation on [creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

#### 1.1. Create secrets, if needed

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your repository is **internal** or **private**, you need to create the
> following secrets in your repository:
>
> - `REPO_CLONER_TOKEN`: use a [fine grained token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) with `read:content` and
> `read:metadata` permissions. **Make sure the token's "resource owner" is _canonical_**, and has access to the right repositories (not just public in this case).
> Also, please note that fine-grained tokens have an expiration date. So if and when experiencing CI problems checking out the repository, make sure the token is still valid.

### 2. Customize the Template

This template comes with a basic setup to get you started. Here's what you need to customize:

- **`rockcraft.yaml`**: This is your rock's [recipe](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/rockcraft/en/stable/reference/rockcraft.yaml/)! Adjust its contents, as well as its parent directories' names according to your rock's name and version.
- **`task.yaml`**: This is your tests' file, it contains the required instructions written in bash for your rock to be tested using [spread](https://github.com/canonical/spread).
- **`SECURITY.md.template`**: Edit the template with your repo's details and set the security policy by renaming this file to `SECURITY.md`.
- **`CODEOWNERS`**: Optional, but recommended. Read more about [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners).

## Directory Structure

Here's an overview of the directory structure of the repository:

```
my-rock-name/                 # Directory containing all versions of a single rock
   └─ 0.1/                    # Directory containing the rock project file for a specific version
      └─ rockcraft.yaml       # Rock project file
      └─ spread.yaml          # Spread test configuration
      └─ spread/              # Spread tests directory
         └─ .extension        # Functions used internally by spread tests
         └─ general/test/     # Directory containing tests
            └─ task.yaml      # Test file
.gitignore
CODEOWNERS                    
README.md                     # Top level document containing this specification
SECURITY.md.template          # Security policy template
```

## Building, testing and uploading the Rock

To build, test and upload the rock to GHCR, simply commit your `rockcraft.yaml`
file and check the GitHub actions.

> [!NOTE]
> Before committing your `rockcraft.yaml`, it is recommended that you `pack` it
> with [Rockcraft](https://snapcraft.io/rockcraft) run a smoke test locally.
> Check the [Rockcraft documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/rockcraft) to learn more.

## Sync with template

A `Makefile` is provided to sync the repository with the latest template changes. To do so, simply run:

```bash
make sync-with-template
```
