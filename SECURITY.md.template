# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

<!--- TODO: Rename this file to SECURITY.md --->
<!--- TODO: Update the Private Security Report link--->

To report a security issue, you can either:
 - file a [Private Security Report](https://github.com/FIXME/security/advisories/new) (see
[Privately reporting a security
vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
for instructions), or
 - email [security@ubuntu.com](mailto:security@ubuntu.com).

When reporting a security issue, please provide a description of
the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions,
and, if known, mitigations for the issue.

The [Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy](https://ubuntu.com/security/disclosure-policy) contains more information about what you can expect when you contact us and what we expect from you.
